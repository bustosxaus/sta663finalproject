    "\n",
    "- The simulation is from the joint, but only the simulations of $\\theta$ are of interest; $\\phi$ is an auxiliary variable introduced to enable the algorithm to move faster through the parameter space\n",

    "- The gradient of the log-posterior density is also required and it must be computed analytically\n",

    "- NUTS: In the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS), the number of steps is determined adaptively at each iteration. Instead of running for a fixed number of steps, L, the trajectory in each iteration continues until it turns around (more specifically, until we reach a negative value of the dot product between the momentum variable $\\phi$ and the distance traveled from the position $\\theta$ at the start of the iteration). This rule essentially sends the trajectory as far as it can go during that iteration. If such a rule is applied alone, the simulations will not converge to the desired target distribution. The full no-U-turn sampler is more complicated, going backward and forward along the trajectory in a way that satisfies detailed balance. Along with this algorithm comes a procedure for adaptively setting the mass matrix M and step size $\\varepsilon$; these parameters are tuned during the warm-up phase and then held fixed during the later iterations which are kept for the purpose of posterior inference.\n",
